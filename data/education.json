        "notes": "\n- The project involved position estimatio of 3-D moving unmanned aerial vehicles(Drones) by integrating intertial navigation systems (Accelerometer and Gyroscope) and GPS.\n- A **9 state Kalman Filter** works on prediction and correction algorithm was designed using simulink to esimate the errors in GPS/INS.\n- Measurement and process noise having covariances **0.1** and **0.01** was de-noised successfully.\n- Further research would involde design of **UNSCENTED KALMAN FILTER** with **UNSUPERVISED LEARNING** for non linear signals and **indoor navigations**"
